							As a team of makers, creatives, and doers, what inspired us was hearing stories of other creatives and why they do what they do. 
						</h1>
						<p>
							We wanted to learn about how different people thought about their own journeys and creative processes. How did they approach their craft? How did they challenge themselves? How might the creative process for a digital designer be similar to that of a style blogger, or a film director? What can we learn from each other?
						</p>
						<p>
							This collection of stories is our way of celebrating creatives who shape our culture and push our society forwards.

						<h2>Who We Are</h2>
						<p>
							We're ISM. We believe that with passion and determination, you can achieve anything. It's why we're constantly inspired by the stories and journeys of creatives like yourself. Because becoming great at your craft isn't easy. It takes a lot of hard work. That's why our mission is to build tools to help you in your journey. 
						</p>
						<p>
							As creative professionals, we came across a familiar problem. We wanted a backpack that could carry all of our work tools, but was stylish enough to bring out at night. We wanted products that could help us get more things done, without compromising on aesthetics.
